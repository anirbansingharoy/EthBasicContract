This is basic smart contract interaction client developed in React. 


## Basic Setup 
  
  **Ganache**
  
  Ganache is a fast and customizable blockchain emulator. It allows you to make calls to the blockchain without the overheads     of running an actual Ethereum node in local. On running on local , it gives you 10 account by default with 100 ethers each.

  *Installation*
  
    npm install -g ganache-cli
    ganache-cli
  
  It will start local blockchain instance at http://127.0.0.1:8545 
  More configuration option can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli)
  
  **Metamask**
  
MetaMask is the easiest way to interact with dapps in a browser. It is an extension for Chrome or Firefox that connects to an Ethereum network without running a full node on the browser's machine. It can connect to the main Ethereum network, any of the testnets (Ropsten, Kovan, and Rinkeby), or a local blockchain such as the one created by Ganache.
