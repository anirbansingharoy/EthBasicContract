This is basic smart contract interaction client developed in React. 


## Basic Setup 
  
  **Ganache**
  
  Ganache is a fast and customizable blockchain emulator. It allows you to make calls to the blockchain without the overheads     of running an actual Ethereum node in local. On running on local , it gives you 10 account by default with 100 ethers each.

  *Installation*
  
    npm install -g ganache-cli
    ganache-cli
